# Addon_Blender_CacheIt

This add-on is for caching the existing animation, physics and mesh deformations to the disk. It will load the cache file back once it is done with caching the selected objects. The caching mechanism relies on the existing Alembic pipeline.


Being able to cache complicated scene setups to the disk is very helpful during production. 


Download this repository as a zip file and install it like a regular Blender add-on.
